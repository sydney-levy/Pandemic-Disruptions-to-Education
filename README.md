# The Global Education Puzzle: Unpacking Out-of-School Rates and Pandemic Disruptions
## Harvard University Fall 2023 
### Final Project for Visualization Course (CS171)

The level of education students are able to obtain varies greatly around the world. We explored how out-of-school rates compare between countries around the globe, including gender differences in out-of-school rates. Further, we focused on the effect that the Covid-19 pandemic had on studentsâ€™ access to education, as many students had trouble continuing their education during this time. We hope this project brings light to the educational inequities that were exacerbated by the Covid-19 pandemic as well as strategies to improving global out of school rates.
